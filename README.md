ARK is a personal project / C++ macro I wrote to numerically solve differential equations using the [Runge-Kutta Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungeâ€“Kutta_methods). This algorithm is implemented using C++, which I chose for its speed and malleability. ARK can solve first order and second order differential equations; examples of ARK solving the exponential ODE and the Simple Harmonic Oscillator can be seen below!

I also wrote a python file to plot the analytic solutions of these ODEs against the numerical solutions from ARK. This can be found in `rk4_analysis.py`, found in both folders.

You may find different versions of ARK in either the `first_order` folder or `second_order` folder. 

This personal project is in active development, so please feel free to submit [issues](https://github.com/isoleph/ARK/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/isoleph/ARK/pulls)!
